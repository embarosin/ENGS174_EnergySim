This project is a fun game/art display that can be used to simulate the amount of energy that can be produced by people dancing on kinetic energy capture tiles. 
Each circle in the simulation represents one person dancing. The faster you type on the keyboard corresponds to higher movement in the crowd. 
The velocity of each ball on the screen determines its kinetic energy, which is proportional by a factor of to the energy created by the tile.
