Welcome to Emily, Elaine, Abby, and Catherine's Dance Dance Energy Game!
The purpose of this simulation is to show a relationship between motion of the circles on the screen (representing patrons at a concert)
and energy generation. On the top left corner of the game you will see the number of Watt-Hours that can be produced from the level of motion you 
are creating using PaveGen tiles on the dance floor. 

Assumptions: 
200 people
100 tiles
Each tile produces 3 J/s with one step.

We hope you enjoy!

**How to Play**

Type anywhere on your keyboard. The faster you type the faster the circles will travel.
